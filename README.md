# VideoSharing
It is project for me to start with [laravel](https://laravel.com/).
`VideoSharing` is a simple website to share videos with other people like youtube.
Now, this website just can list top ten popular videos on the index page and have no search functionality.
I am going to improve this project as soon as I can.

### Requirements
* PHP >= 5.6.4
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### Quickstart
* Start server.
```bash
cd VideoSharing
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

* Connect server through browser http://localhost:8000.

### TODOs
 - Search functionality.
 - A better method to show the appropriate videos to clients.
